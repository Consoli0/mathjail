I read about a mathematics jail problem, and decided to do one

There are 100 jail cells, they are all closed, there are 100 guards, each has a key that can lock and unlock every cell.

- Guard 1 toggles (unlocks in this case) every cell.
- Guard 2 toggles (locks in this case) every 2nd cell.
- Guard 3 toggles every 3rd cell.
And so on.

What's the intermediate and final values?

That's what I set out to do, and succeeded.

Made in TypeScript.

  this came right out of my testing folder so that's why I commited the files on GitHub instead of pushing from a local repo.
